				<p>The Hello Mario Engine has changed a lot since it was originally released. In the past, the engine had different names, and did not have the fully commented code it has today. This page will document the various changes made to the engine.</p>

				<h1 id="1" class="page-header">Hello's Mario Engine</h1>
				<p>The first release of this engine was simply called <strong>Hello's Mario Engine</strong>, and was released in early 2007 for Game Maker 6. It used messy Drag&amp;Drop code, ran at a locked 30fps, and had numerous glitches and physics problems. The only game Hello Fangaming released using this version of the engine was <a href="Super Mario Bros Mushroom Journey.html">Super Mario Bros: Mushroom Journey</a>. An earlier version prior to this one was shown off at one point, but nothing was actually made with it. That engine was quickly scrapped after the first demo was posted.</p>

				<h1 id="2" class="page-header">Hello Engine 2</h1>
				<p>The next version of the engine, also released in 2007, was called <strong>Hello Engine 2</strong>. The entire engine was rewritten with new Drag&amp;Drop code, which allowed for climbing, swimming, and slopes that weren't terrible. It originally ran at 30fps, but was converted to 60fps after the release of <a href="Super Mario Bros Koopa Chaos.html">Super Mario Bros: Koopa Chaos</a>. This version of the engine was never actually released open source, and the last game to use it was <a href="Super Mario Bros Shine Pursuit.html">Super Mario Bros: Shine Pursuit</a>. This version's code was scrapped and rewritten from scratch because of the messy Drag&amp;Drop code that made it difficult to modify.</p>

				<h1 id="3" class="page-header">Hello Engine 3</h1>
				<p>Near the end of 2007, the <strong>Hello Engine 3</strong> was released. This version was built off an open source SMB2 engine Hello Fangaming released in the past, but with all of the <strong>Hello Engine 2</strong> features ported over. This allowed for all the Drag&amp;Drop code from the previous version to be replaced with code written in Game Maker Language. This version ended up being used in a popular title called <strong>Mushroom Kingdom Fusion</strong>, which, unfortunately, got cancelled due to excessive bloat. The first and last games Hello Fangaming released using this version are <a href="Super Mario Bros Revenge of Bowser.html">Super Mario Bros: Revenge of Bowser</a> and <a href="Super Mario Bros Seeking Sunshine.html">Super Mario Bros: Seeking Sunshine</a>.</p>

				<h1 id="4" class="page-header">Hello Engine 4</h1>
				<p>Near the end of 2009, the <strong>Hello Engine 4</strong> was released. This version was the first to be released for Game Maker 8, and was built directly off of the <strong>Hello Engine 3</strong>. This version included an improved world map, an assortment of new powerups, enemies, and items, and improved game mechanics. An early version of this engine was used in <a href="Hello Winter Mario Games 2009.html">Hello Winter Mario Games 2009</a> before it was released, and the engine was later used in <a href="Super Mario Bros Restless Reality.html">Super Mario Bros: Restless Reality</a>.</p>

				<h1 id="5" class="page-header">Hello (Mario) Engine 5.X</h1>
				<p>During the summer of 2011, the <strong>Hello Engine 5</strong> was released. This version was built directly off of the <strong>Hello Engine 4</strong>, included an assortment of new features, and its code was finally indented properly, making it a lot more readable. Later on, the <strong>Hello Engine 5.1</strong> was released, which finally dealt with the engine's physics problems, giving Mario more accurate physics. Both <a href="Super Mario Bros Mythical Mushrooms.html">Super Mario Bros: Mythical Mushrooms</a> and <a href="Super Mario Bros Ztar Turmoil.html">Super Mario Bros: Ztar Turmoil</a> used these versions of the engine. Later in 2013, the engine was updated to version 5.2, renamed to <strong>Hello Mario Engine</strong>, and ported to GameMaker: Studio. This port was used in the creation of <a href="Super Mario Eclipse.html">Super Mario Eclipse</a>.</p>

				<h1 id="6" class="page-header">Hello Mario Engine 6.X</h1>
				<p>During the summer of 2014, version 6.0 of the engine was released, and included a complete code overhaul. All the engine's code was fully commented and optimized for user-friendliness by fixing the engine's duplicate code problem and making it easier to add new features with minimal code. An assortment of new powerups, enemies, and items were also added. This version of the engine was used to create <a href="Super Mario Dynamo.html">Super Mario Dynamo</a>. On early 2015, version 6.1 was released, which changed the default aspect ratio to 16:9 widescreen, added a wall jump shroom powerup, and various additional features and bug fixes. This version got used in both the <a href="Hello Fangaming Collection.html">Hello Fangaming Collection</a>, and <a href="Mario Editor.html">Mario Editor</a>. On late 2018, version 6.2 was released, which added seven new powerups and brought together all seven Koopalings. At the end of 2019, the engine received its final update and was discontinued due to Hello Fangaming quitting GameMaker.</p>
